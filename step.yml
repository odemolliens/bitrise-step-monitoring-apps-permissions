  Mobile apps permissions monitoring
summary: |
  Check and monitor mobile applications permissions
description: |
  Check mobile applications permissions and compare with configured values to be warned when new permissions have been added

  ### Usage

  To give to our step the information about the expected values, you have:
  - create a config file (which should be added to your project repository) and set `config_file_path`  to find them. You can find a config example file [here](https://github.com/imranMnts/bitrise-step-monitoring-apps-permissions#config-file-example)
  - **OR** set these keys with expected values directly on Bitrise side
    - android_permission_count
    - ios_permission_count

  ### Troubleshooting

  - Be aware, you have to launch this step after [apps-decompiler](https://github.com/imranMnts/bitrise-step-apps-decompiler) step

        The config file where we have some information like the current Android app size eg. to compare with next builds and alert if needed.
        If you want use Environment Variables instead of the config file, do not set this key and add variables. (See [README](https://github.com/imranMnts/bitrise-step-monitoring-apps-permissions/blob/master/README.md) to see all needed variables)

        Set this key if you want to follow up the count of permission used by your Android app and be aware when useless permission added to your AndroidManifest.xml

        To know how many permission you have currently in your app, you can check your APK's manifest to know the exact count.

        You can add a config file where you can add all application information and set `config_file_path` to find it.

        Tip: You can set it to 0 and launch one time this step to check report file to know the current value.
